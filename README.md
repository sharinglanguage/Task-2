# Task-2
First file to see should be conexioninclude.php, since it is the file which includes the PHP Mysql function to connect to the database.
Its parameters would be changed for real ones, so that the application, through the file named panda_import, could be run on the browser

Then the file to be run is panda_table since it includes the file to create the table in the database

Then panda_import (which could have beem named index.php) is the file that corresponds to the page the user would access in order to import the CSV files. 
The file panda_functions is called from it.
